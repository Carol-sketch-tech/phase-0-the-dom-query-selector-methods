# my personal notes.
query selectora take one argument. these argument are the identifires of css selectors. for example an id in an html document might have an id that id when being accessed by a 
querySelectir() it will use the selector # tag to show that it is an Id and   dot to show that it is class.

## query selectors 
they take one argument. 

# querySelectorAll()
it works jus tlike the querySelector()
it takes a string of more than one selector
and it searhes starting from the object that its called on( either a document or an element.)
however instead of returning the first match, it return a node list collection of all matching elements.
a node list is similar to an Htmlcollection. it is an array-like structure containing a list of DOM nodes.
